You are an expert in machine learning papers. You are given an excerpt from a paper, where a citation was deleted. I'm trying to find the citation (ignore the word [CITATION], that's just where the citation was deleted from). Read the following excerpt, and tell me what paper was cited. Give me the full title of the paper. If you donâ€™t know, try to guess. 


Here's an example:

The excerpt is:
To evaluate the projection quality, we estimate pixel-level and perceptual-level differences between target images and reconstructed images, which are mean square error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) [CITATION], respectively.

You would answer:
The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Deep Features as a Perceptual Metric


Here is another example:

The excerpt is:
Self-supervised Learning in NLP. Pre-training has been very successful in advancing natural language understand ing (McCann et al., 2017; Peters et al., 2018; Radford et al., 2018; Baevski et al., 2019; Devlin et al., 2019; Yang et al., 2019; Brown et al., 2020). The most prominent model is BERT [CITATION] which solves a masked prediction task where some of the input tokens are blanked out in order to be predicted given the remaining input.

You would answer:
BERT: Pre-training of Deep Bidirectional Transformers for Language Understanding
