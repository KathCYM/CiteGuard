You are an expert in machine learning papers. You are given an excerpt from a paper, where a citation was deleted. I'm trying to find the citation (ignore the word [CITATION], that's just where the citation was deleted from). Read the following excerpt, and tell me what paper was cited. Tell me what to search in order to find the paper.

<FORMAT_INSTRUCTIONS>

For example, given the excerpt:
To evaluate the projection quality, we estimate pixel-level and perceptual-level differences between target images and reconstructed images, which are mean square error (MSE) and learned perceptual image patch similarity (LPIPS) [CITATION], respectively.
We should search for "LPIPS metric":
{
    "reason": "The paper we're looking for is a metric called LPIPS. As this is a specific term, we'll search by citations and not by relevance.",
    "action": {
        "name": "search_citation_count",
        "query": "LPIPS metric"
    }
}
